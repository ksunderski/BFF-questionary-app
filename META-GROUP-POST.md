# Meta Group Post: BFF Questionary Prototype

---

## 🎯 **Sharing My First "Vibe Coding" Project!**

Hey everyone! 👋

I wanted to share something I've been working on that's opened my eyes to a completely new way of building tools – even with minimal coding experience.

### **The Journey: From Zero to Prototype**

As someone with **very little coding background**, I recently attended the [Vibe Coding @ Meta (XFN-Friendly)](http://fburl.com/vibe-code) workshop and decided to put it into practice. The result? A fully functional web app built in just a few days! 🚀

**What I built:** [BFF Questionary](https://github.com/ksunderski/BFF-questionary-app) - A nostalgic 80s/90s-themed friendship questionnaire app where you can:
- Create custom questionnaires
- Share them with friends via unique BFF codes
- Receive and fill out questionnaires
- View friends' answers in a fun, interactive format
- Decorate pages with draggable stickers 🎨

### **The Tech Behind It**

This isn't just a static mockup – it's a **real, cloud-connected application** using:
- ✅ Meta's internal AI infrastructure (Wearables APE)
- ✅ Cloud-based data persistence (30-day storage)
- ✅ Real-time cross-user communication
- ✅ LLM-powered logic (GPT-4o)
- ✅ Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (runs locally!)

**The best part?** I didn't need to be a senior engineer to build this. AI coding assistants (Claude Sonnet 4.5) wrote most of the code while I focused on the *what* and *why*, not the *how*.

### **Why This Matters for Our Team**

This proof-of-concept has me thinking about all the internal tools we could build using this approach:

**🔧 Potential Use Cases:**
- **Retail Demo Automation Scripts** - Quickly prototype demo workflows without deep Python knowledge
- **Bug Tracking Tools** - Custom dashboards tailored to our team's specific needs
- **Management Tools** - Reports, trackers, and automation for daily operations
- **QA Test Generators** - Automated test case creation and execution
- **Data Analysis Dashboards** - Visual insights without needing to master Tableau

The barrier to entry for creating custom tools just dropped dramatically. If I can build a full-stack app with minimal experience, imagine what subject matter experts (who know *exactly* what they need) could build!

### **Try It Yourself!**

**Setup Time:** ~5 minutes
**Requirements:** Mac + Chrome + Meta network access

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ksunderski/BFF-questionary-app.git
   cd BFF-questionary-app
   open index.html -a "Google Chrome"
   ```

2. **Get your API key:**
   - Visit: https://wearables-ape.io/settings/api-keys
   - Generate a new key
   - Paste it when the app prompts you

3. **Test with a friend:**
   - Create a questionnaire
   - Generate a friend code
   - Share it with a colleague
   - They redeem the code and fill it out
   - View their answers!

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **AI-assisted coding is real** - Not just hype, genuinely productive for prototypes
2. **Non-engineers can build tools** - Domain expertise + AI = powerful combination
3. **Rapid iteration is possible** - Built and deployed in days, not months
4. **Perfect for internal tooling** - Fast prototypes for specific team needs

### **What's Next?**

I'm eager to apply this approach to actual work projects. If anyone on the team has ideas for automation scripts or internal tools they wish existed, let's chat! Maybe we can "vibe code" it together. 😊

**Questions?** Happy to discuss the process, share lessons learned, or help anyone get started with their own vibe coding projects!
